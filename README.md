# 2020 Icon & Return

The first icon was a gift from github.  

This is an update for my icon. This can be a perfect place to keep codes & icons.  

It has been too long since I have worked on github or bitbucket.  

Spark the fire up and time to flood them some love.  

Let the 2020 journey begin!
